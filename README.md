---
This project includes R scripts employed in constructing a comprehensive wound macrophage ATLAS, as well as conducting RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and CUT&RUN-seq analyses.

Input data for scRNA-seq ATLAS are publicly available (The accession code can be obtained from Supplementary Table 2 of DOI:XXXXXXXXXXX). Input data for RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and CUT&RUN-seq analysis can be obtained from GEO under accession code GSE252899, GSE252900 and GSE269832. Input data for lipidomics analysis can be obtained from Supplementary Table 3 of the source article (DOI:XXXXXXXXXXXX). Other data that generated in these analysis are available from the corresponding author upon request.

All the analyses were carried out using R (version 4.3.2)
